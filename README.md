## Details:
This is the Repo of an Academic project based on Machine Learning. This Project uses the public data of NEWS from [Kaggle: Fake and Real New Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/data)

This Project uses multiple Machine Learning models such as LSTM, Naive Bayes, SVM, and CNN for training and testing on data.
There are mainly 2 components of this project API.py which is the bridge between the Front-End and Trained Models and the Trained saved model.

## To Start the APIs follow the below steps
1. Clone The repo using ```git clone https://github.com/JayJoshi4520/DATA-245-ML-Project.git```
2. ```cd DATA-245-ML-Project```
3. If you do not have virtualenv installed, install using: ```pip install virtualenv```
4. ```python -m venv data245-project``` || ```python3 -m venv data245-project```
5. ```source data245-project/bin/activate```
6. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
7. ``` python API.py ```
### ***Note***: if the above command doesn't work try this below command.
``` python3 API.py ```


## To Start the Front-end follow the given steps.
1. Clone the Repo using the below command
   ```git clone https://github.com/JayJoshi4520/DATA-245-ML-Project.git```
3. Open Clonned Repo using ```cd DATA-245-ML-Project``` 
4. Travel to the folder ml_project using ```cd ml_project```
5. Before starting the project, install the prerequisites and dependencies by using the below command.
    ```npm install```
6. After completing the above command, now start the project using ```npm start```
